[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at Duke University and an USIP-Minerva Peace and Security Scholar. My research interests lie at the intersection of comparative political institutions and political behavior. As a comparativist, my research agenda seeks to understand the factors that lead to the emergence of the rule of law in post-conflict settings. A more complete understanding of the emergence and maintenance of the rule of law requires an approach that incorporates institutional factors as well as the micro- foundations of behavior at both the elite and mass levels.\nMy dissertation investigates how land courts enforced their rulings in Colombia’s ongoing land restitution program, and, in turn, why politicians and bureaucrats comply with these judicial decisions protecting property rights, while others do not, both at the national and local level.\nAt Duke, I have taught interdisciplinary courses at the Sanford School of Public Policy. I am affiliated with the PhD Lab in Digital Knowledge where we engage the challenges and promises of digital research and pedagogy.\nBefore coming to Duke, I worked at the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) at Vanderbilt University. Currently, I am affiliated with the DevLab@Duke where we collaborate on the design and evaluation of international development programs. I conducted an evaluation of the USAID/Colombia’s Land and Rural Development Program (LRDP, 2013-2018).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"montoyana.github.io/author/ana-maria-montoya/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"montoyana.github.io/author/ana-maria-montoya/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at Duke University and an USIP-Minerva Peace and Security Scholar.

A large, quantitative literature has found evidence for numerous variables serving as potential drivers of public support of and opposition to conflict negotiations.

In this article, we leverage a large amount of nationally representative survey data from Colombia (2004–2015) and use machine learning tools to systematically explore which variables are the strongest predictors of public support for negotiations with Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC). We find that certain aspects of conflict exposure, individual values bearing on justice and punishment, and belief in the efficacy of the state are among the strongest predictors of negotiation preferences, while many conventionally important variables in the literature have little predictive power.
